# A600_ACCEL_RAM
Design attempt for an Amiga 600 over CPU (PLCC) 68000 Accelerator including FastRAM and MapROM support.

# Warning
This design has not been compliance tested and will not be. It may cause damage to your A600. I take no responsibility for this. I accept no responsibility for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this design and its components. IT IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!

# Overview
The main purpose of this design was to develop a simple, affordable and efficient Accelerator, FastRAM and MapROM support device for the Amiga 600. The main components of the design and the CPU (MC68SEC000), CPLD (9572) and SRAM (CY62167G). There are the odd LEDs for status and some IO Pins for currently unplanned additions. As discovered in my A500 Accelerator the MC68SEC000 can be aggressively clocked and this design does not detour from that.

### Appearance
Nice 3D model:

### BOM (Coming Soon)
For those wanting to build their own hardware, here is the BOM;

### CPU
Regarding the CPU, I purchased from here (I get nothing from this. The parts I received were new and legitimate so I wanted to share the source);
